Simple todo list for js using node, express framework and mongoDB.

To test it out please do the following:
1. clone this repo
2. install and run mongoDB (you can use oficial documentation to do so)
3. `npm install`
(If you don't have npm - install nodeJS on your computer)
4. go to your project folder and run `node app.js`
5. That's it. The project should be on localhost:3000

If you still can't run it or you found any bugs in it - please feel free to open the issue or write me directly.
